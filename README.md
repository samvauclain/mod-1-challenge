This repository contains refactored code for Horiseon's homepage. This was done to make the HTML & CSS more effecient, as well as to improve accessibility for the site.


## HTML
In order to improve accessibilty in the HTML, the following was done:    
    -Added a number of symantic HTML tags, to help with organization understanding, for both accesibilty readers for search engines. 

## CSS
In order to make the CSS more effecient, the following was done:
    - There were multiple classes sharing the same styles, these were combined
    - In some cases, CSS selector classes were removed by selecting HTML symantic tags and their children tags instead.

These updates can be seen on the web by [clicking here:]()
